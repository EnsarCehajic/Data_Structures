# Data Structures

This repository hosts my implementations of fundamental data structures. It's created as part of my academic project at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Tuzla. The aim is to provide clear, well-commented code along with examples for better understanding and practical learning.

## Repository Structure

- **Vector**: Implementation of dynamic arrays.
- **List**: Various types of lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular lists.
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure implementations.
- **Queue**: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure implementations, including circular queues.
- **Tree**: Different types of trees, such as binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Hash Map**: Implementation of hash tables with collision resolution techniques like chaining and open addressing.

## How to Use

Each directory contains:

- **Source Code**: The main implementation of the data structure.
- **Tests**: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.
- **Documentation**: Explanations and comments within the code, as well as additional README files where necessary, describing the data structure, its usage, and examples.
